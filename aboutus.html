  <h2>About us:</h2>  
<p>Over 4.5 lakh students received education across 3,000 government schools; engineering scholarships will be given out to 500 girls in 2023.
</p>
<p><li>A million students enroll in computer science engineering courses annually in India. However, only a small percentage of those students come from underserved and underrepresented communities.<br>From limited access to computers and low exposure to career opportunities and mentors in this field to language constraints in accessing coding curriculum.<br>The students face systemic barriers to aspire for a career in the technology industry.</li></p>

Live Chats with Amazonians In the past one year, AFE has provided high quality computer science exploration and learning opportunities to 4.5 Lakh students from more than 3,000 government schools across 11 states in India. This also includes above 600 live Class Chats to expose students to real-world careers that exist in the tech industry. More than 40,000 students have participated in Class Chats delivered by over 150 Amazon volunteers till date across diverse roles.</li>

India's Techade “Post Covid, the rapid rate of digitalisation across the globe offers tremendous opportunities for India and Young Indians. Prime Minister Modi has envisioned the coming decade as India’s Techade - one that would be driven by young Indians. Our government is fully committed to empower its citizens with industry-relevant skills and job opportunities through various skilling, upskilling and re-skilling programmes - with a special focus on Digital Skills," said Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Minister of State in the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship; and Electronics and Information Technology. "I appreciate Amazon India’s Future Engineer Program, which provides our underprivileged students relevant training and skillsets through government schools. I wish them all the very best in continuing this program and strengthening Prime Minister Modi Ji's vision of New India and Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayaas,” Chandrasekhar added.</li></p>

Transforming the lives of budding engineers In 2021, Amazon Future Engineer scholarships were provided to 200 female students from low income families to pursue computer science engineering. Seeing the success of this program, Amazon is extending the scholarship to support 500 more students this year. The selected students will receive Rs 40,000 per year for the duration of their courses in computer science or related fields of study. The program besides financial support also provides mentorship by Amazon employees and advanced personalized coding boot camps to scholars to help them transition into successful careers in tech industry.</li>
